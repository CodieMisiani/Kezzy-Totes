3. ðŸ’¼ Full Modern Tech Stack
To make Kezzy Totes recruiter-worthy, weâ€™ll select a modern, scalable, and widely adopted tech stack that balances complexity with practicality. This stack will showcase your ability to work with industry-standard tools while keeping the project achievable in a week.

Frontend:
React (with TypeScript): For a fast, component-based UI with type safety, popular in modern web development.
Next.js: For server-side rendering, static site generation, and SEO optimization, making the app feel professional and performant.
Tailwind CSS: For rapid, responsive UI styling with a modern design system, reducing dependency on heavy frameworks like Bootstrap.
React Query: For efficient data fetching, caching, and real-time updates (e.g., stock levels).
Shadcn/ui: A collection of reusable components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS. Excellent for quick, high-quality UI development.
Recharts: A composable charting library built on React components, ideal for data visualizations in an admin dashboard.

Backend & Database:
Firebase (Firestore, Authentication, Storage, Cloud Functions): A comprehensive Google-backed platform.
Firestore: NoSQL document database for flexible and scalable data storage (products, orders, users). Its real-time capabilities are perfect for order management.
Firebase Authentication: Handles user registration, login, and session management securely.
Firebase Storage: For storing product images.
Firebase Cloud Functions (Optional for complex logic): Serverless functions for backend logic (e.g., payment processing webhooks, complex inventory updates).
Mpesa-DarajaAPI (for Payments): Industry-standard API for secure and robust payment processing.

Deployment & Hosting:
Vercel (for Frontend): Excellent for Next.js applications, offering seamless deployment, automatic SSL, and global CDN.
Firebase Hosting (for Frontend/Static Assets): Can also host your React app if not using Next.js/Vercel.
Firebase (for Backend/Database/Functions): Managed services, so no separate backend server deployment needed.

ðŸš€ Advanced Features (Showcasing Technical Depth):
The "Real-time Order Management and Stock Updates" combined with an "Admin Dashboard with Live Data Visualizations"

Real-time Order Management & Stock Updates:

Technical Depth: Utilizes Firestore's real-time listeners (onSnapshot) to instantly update order statuses and product quantities across all connected clients (customer and admin).
Implementation: When a customer places an order, the product's stock count in Firestore is decremented. If stock is low, the product might be marked as "out of stock" or "limited availability." The admin dashboard instantly reflects new orders and stock changes.
Value: Provides immediate feedback to both customers and administrators, preventing overselling and improving operational efficiency.

Admin Dashboard with Live Data Visualizations:

Technical Depth: Integrates Recharts to display key metrics (e.g., daily sales, top-selling products, order status distribution) with data pulled in real-time from Firestore. Implements role-based access control to secure the admin section.
Implementation: A dedicated protected route for administrators. The dashboard fetches data using Firestore queries and displays it using various chart types (bar charts for sales, pie charts for order status).
Value: Offers actionable insights for the shop owner, enabling data-driven decisions and efficient management.
